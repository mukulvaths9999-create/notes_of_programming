  __unalias rm__ to remove the rm as an alias

  
## removing a file
  -> __rm "file one"__  
## i node number
  -> __ls -li__  
  __combining the i node and showing all__  
  -> __ls -lia__

  --> also like __ls -l --directory --inode level1__ some has long form some does not, use man command for it 

## knowing files better wali command   
  -> __less profile__ to see content of a file, here profile is name of the file

  __remove a filled directory -> not possible, so either make it empty or__ 
  use __rm -r mydir__ forced removal of directory   

  -> copying one direcotry to other __  
  __mv dir1/file1 dir2/__ directly moving files without changing directory , source destination   
  __cp -r mydir mydir2__  copy command does not assume recurssion we have to give -r so that it can work  
  but _mv_ commands assumer recursssion so we dont have to tell explicitly  

  __cp -r level1/* new_direct/__ copying inside content of level1 directory to new_direct   

## links : _make links between files_ 
  __ln -s file1 file2 => ln -l source destination__  (soft link ) 
  __ln file1 file2__ creating without s will give them the same i node number (hard link )    

## file size:
_files if they are less than a block take whole block or take {no block}, they will never take part of a block_

## combining commands and files 
__ls ; date ; wc -l /etc/profile ;__ execute all commands one by one 
__(ls ; date ; wc -l /etc/profile ;)__ execute in a subshelll 
__echo $BASH_SUBSHELL__ to see the subshell no.

__(echo $BASH_SUBSHELL)__ 
__1__
to see what subshell is there (when you use bracket it executes in a subshell)

__ls /blah && date__ it means that second command only works if first commands works (like and )
__ls /blah || date__ it means second is only executed if first fails 

______________________________  
__ls -1 /usr/bin__ it will give one command per line of the output

__command >> file1__ it will append the file and if not exist it will be created 

__ls $HOME /blah 2> error.txt__ first it will redirect the eroor to eroor.txt file , it will not show error that occured on screen bcoz it redirect it into error.txt file 

## REDIRECTIONS 

__cat < error.txt__ (redirecting the input from keyboard to use file content )
-
__wc < error.txt__ it means content has to be read form command line 
__ls $HOME /blah > file1 2>&1__ redirect both output and error to file1 

__ls /usr/bin | wc -l__ redirecting output of one command to input of second command , but error are only directed to screen 

__ls /usr/bin | wc -l > file1__ (upper command and )redirect output of second command to file1 

__/dev/null__ black hole to direct things (dev is very sensitive do not use anythings else)

*mukul_pandit@DESKTOP-O2A5EAO:/var/lib/dpkg/info$ md5sum /usr/bin/wget* 
_c57c56d1d70b45a9327bbb679c8bd43  /usr/bin/wget_

to see if the file has been tempered or not 
__apt search fortune__ to search commands related to it 
## use dpkg

*gives us information about a package* 

__dpkg -l nmap__ gives informatin about the architecture (list)
__dpkg -L nmap__ give us the various files that are installed with nmap package (list files) 
__apt-cache show (package_name)__ == __dpkg -s nmap__  gives utilites about that package (status)

*dpkg -S /usr/bin/perl* (search)
*perl-base: /usr/bin/perl*  shows from where this particular package has come (location ) 

__dpkg -S /usr/bin/perl__ search for which installed package owns a specific file. (search)

**dpkg-query -W -f='${Section} ${binary:package}\n'** it will give me a list of all the section and within each section what are the binary package  

__dpkg-query -W -f='${Section} ${binary:package}\n' | grep shells__ it filter the line that only have the 

## linux operating system 

**sleep 3** making it sleep for 3 second 

__coproc sleep 10__ getting 10 second to type anything in sleep and then session gets over 
__ps --forest__ to see the p ID of the bash shell and now 
__kill -9 754__ that 954 is pid , that is used to kill the process 

__sleep 30 &__ , _&_ to put the process in background , type _fg_ to put it in foregroung and then use ctrl + c to kill it 

__jobs__ to see the backgroung process 
__top__ tell about the process running in cpu ,_q_ or _ctrl+c_ for kill, _ctrl+z_ for suspending the task then _fg_ for getting in foregroung and then kill it 

__bash -c "echo \$-"__ initiating a child shell 

__bash -c "echo \$$; echo \$-; ps --forest"__ first is giving the pid ,second is shell that lacks interatcive thing , and third is forest 

__history__ 
__echo{a..z}__ print all alphabet a to z 
__echo*__ to list all the files in pwd

## error code wala method 
__echo $?__ will give zero if previous code ran without error , but give between 1 to 255 if the prev. code had some error , the number depend on type of error 

__ps -e__ list the all process that is running in the background 

_he instructor is demonstrating that Linux exit codes are limited to a range of 0–255, so any value higher than that is treated as a modulo 256 operation._

__comm -12__: The comm command compares two files line by line.
*-1 suppresses the output of lines unique to the first file.*
*-2 suppresses the output of lines unique to the second file.*
*By using -12, only the third column (lines common to both files) is displayed.* 

**tr**: *A character-translation utility. It operates by mapping individual characters from one set to another rather than performing* *string-level replacements.*
